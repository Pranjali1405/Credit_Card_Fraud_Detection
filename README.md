# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing transaction data, the project aims to build predictive models that can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities effectively.

# Work Flow  
Data Collection :  
Gather the credit card transaction dataset from a trusted source (e.g., Kaggle).  
Load the data into Python using libraries like Pandas.  
Data Pre-processing :  
Clean the dataset by handling missing values and duplicates.  
Scale and normalize numerical features for better model performance.  
Data Analysis :  
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.  
Train Test Split :  
Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).  
Ensure the split maintains the class distribution for both fraudulent and legitimate transactions.  
Machine Learning :  
Train multiple models to detect fraud, such as:
Logistic Regression  
Decision Trees  
Support Vector Machine  
K-Nearest Neighbors  
Evaluation :  
Assess the models using key metrics:  
Accuracy  
Precision  
Recall  
F1-Score
